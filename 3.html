  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p><a href="https://techterms.com/definition/javascript" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">JavaScript</a> is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites.
